Huge changes!

> Minor: db.csv now sorted to show newer posts at the top, and also get rid of duplicate URL entries.

This means the model does not start from the beginning on every run. It looks for a database and adds more to it.
The drivers.populate file handles taking data from db.csv. 
> Generating the message for the folium markers is handled by drivers.populate as well
generate_map function shifted to drivers.populate as well.
> dash11.py now mostly handles collecting the data and running the drivers. Let's see if I
can just make this call the drivers and put everything under drivers.
